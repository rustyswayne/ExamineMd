## Configuration

Merchello configuration is done in the Umbraco backend Merchello section. You can control the product catalog, inventory, shipping, payment, taxation, and notifications.

### Configure Merchello Global Product Properties

Merchello configuration includes some general settings for the product catalog such as currency, date format, and taxability.

We should set a few global properties for Merchello products. This will save time by NOT having to set the properties for each product as it is added to the catalog.

Go to Merchello/Settings. Select any property that applies to MOST of your products:

- All items are taxable
- All items are shippable
- Track Inventory for all items and variants
- Shipping charges are taxable
