###System Requirements###
The Merchello API is written entirely in C-Sharp (C#).  You are certainly welcome to use your favorite editor to modify the class files.   However you must have MSBUILD installed on your computer to compile the Merchello class files.

The admin UI of Merchello is based on the AngularJS library and written using HTML, JavaScript and JQuery.  If you intend to modify Admin UI behavior, you should have a solid familiarity of all three.

Merchello currently supports **Microsoft SQL Server 2008 or greater**.   MySQL 5.x support is included but untested.

Merchello doesn't run without **Umbraco 7**.  So [download Umbraco 7](http://www.umbraco.org/) and get it working on your computer before proceeding. 

Accessing the Merchello repository of source code requires a GitHub account.  You can [sign up for GitHub](http://www.github.com) and then create your own fork of the [Merchello Repository]({{ site.url }}).      

You'll need some sort of Git-compatible client for your development PC.  We use [SourceTree](http://sourcetreeapp.com/) but you are welcome to use any tool you find the most beneficial to you.

Remember, you are working with a forked copy of the original source code.  You can change, modify or delete anything you want.  Any changes you are interested in seeing applied to the original source code should be submitted to the master copy via a standard GitHub pull request.

Please review our [Project Submissions Statement](/project-home/) for details on our pull request review process.
