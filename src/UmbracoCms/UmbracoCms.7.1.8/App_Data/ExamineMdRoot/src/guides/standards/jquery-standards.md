Ensure that you have read the [JavaScript Guidelines](/developers/javascript-standards/) document before continuing. As documented in [JavaScript Guidelines](/developers/javascript-standards/), method names are named in "camelCase" and therefore jQuery plugins (since they are methods) are named as "camelCase".

Just like with other JavaScript in the Umbraco back-office, you need to wrap your class in the jQuery self executing function if you want to use the dollar ($) operator.

##Simple jQuery plugins##
Simple jQuery plugins don't require an internal class to perform the functionality and therefor do not expose or return an API. These could be as simple as vertically aligning something:

	(function($) {
	    $.fn.verticalAlign = function(opts) {
	        //were not using opts (options) for this plugin
	        //but you could!
	        return this.each(function() {
	            var top = (($(this).parent().height() - $(this).height()) / 2);
	            $(this).css('margin-top', top);
	        });
	    };
	})(jQuery);
##Standard jQuery plugins##
Most jQuery plugins will expose an API or a way in which a developer can interact with the plugin, not just instantiating it. To do this we need to create a class that does the work of the plugin and then expose that class via a different jQuery plugin.

Naming Conventions

There's many different ways to expose an API for a jQuery plugin, in Umbraco the standard will be:



- $("#myId").myFirstJQueryPlugin(); = to instantiate the plugin
- var pluginApi = $("#myId").myFirstJQueryPluginApi(); = to retrieve the plugin API for that selector

So essentially, we'll be creating 2 plugins, one to instantiate it and one to retrieve the API. The naming conventions are obvious, create your plugin name and then append the term Api to it to create your API plugin name.

##Creating the plugins##

//using the same vertical align concept but we'll expose an API for it //( not that this is very useful :) )

	Umbraco.Sys.registerNamespace("MyProject.MyNamespace");
	
	(function($) {
	
	    //create the standard jQuery plugin
	
	    $.fn.verticalAlign = function(opts) {
	        //were not using opts (options) for this plugin
	        //but you could!
	        return this.each(function() {
	            //create the aligner for the current element
	            var aligner = new MyProject.MyNamespace.VerticalAligner($(this));
	        });
	    };
	
	    //create the Api retriever plugin
	
	    $.fn.verticalAlignApi = function () {
	        //ensure there's only 1
	        if ($(this).length != 1) {
	            throw "Requesting the API can only match one element";
	        }
	        //ensure this has a vertical aligner applied to it
	        if ($(this).data("api") == null) {
	            throw "The matching element had not been bound to a VerticalAligner ";
	        }
	        return $(this).data("api");
	    }
	
	    //Create a js class to support the plugin
	
	    MyProject.MyNamespace.verticalAligner = function(elem) {
	       //the jQuery selector
	       var _e = elem;
	       var api = {
	          align: function() {
	             var top = ((_e.parent().height() - _e.height()) / 2);
	             _e.css('margin-top', top);
	          }
	       }
	       //store the api object in the jquery data object for 
	       //the current selector
	       _e.data("api", api);
	       //return the api object
	       return api;
	    }
	
	})(jQuery);
##Consuming the plugins##

To use the plugin and api is very easy:

NOTE: this is an example plugin, i realize this is not really that useful as a non-simple plugin!

	$("#myId").verticalAlign();
	//now to get the api and do the alignment
	$("#myId").verticalAlignApi().align();
