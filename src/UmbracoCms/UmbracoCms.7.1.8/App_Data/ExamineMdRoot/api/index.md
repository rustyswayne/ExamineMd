Welcome to the API section of the Merchello documentation.   Here you will find juicy technical references for all of the key Merchello API classes.   

We define an API class as something that provides a conduit between your site pages and the core Merchello functionality.   For instance, you need a way to add an item to a basket.  But you don't want to have to deal with the persistence layer.   The Merchello API routines expose useful methods that make adding a basket item a snap.  Yes, I said SNAP!

Use the sidebar menu to select the desired class.   All pages in the API documentation have the same sidebar menu to permit quick and easy navigation.
