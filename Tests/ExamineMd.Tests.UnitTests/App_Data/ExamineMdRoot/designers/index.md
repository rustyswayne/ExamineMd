Welcome to the Designers section of our documentation.   We've built this section especially for people who need to quickly blend Merchello functionality into Umbraco pages.  Sections include helpful information for building an add-to-basket button, a basket page and detailed explanation of the entire checkout process.

Included with each section are tips and working code directly from the Merchello core team.
