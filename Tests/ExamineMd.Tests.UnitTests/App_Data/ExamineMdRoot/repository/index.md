A clean, healthy home is a happy home.   Don't muck up our code, and we won't muck up your day.

###Submissions Statement###
We have adopted a list of standards, policies and procedures for reviewing and integrating community code changes to the master repository.   Having a project-wide policy in place ensures everyone's work adheres to the same set of standards.

###What is a Code Submission?###
Merchello is a software project built for the community.   A community member first creates a fork of the master copy of source code.  They then make their own changes to the code and improve the project.   Thanks to their generous community spirit, the community member submits a pull request of their changes back to the master copy.  Good karma bubbles appear above their head and the day is brighter for everyone.

###Who Manages Code Submissions?###
All pull requests for code submission are reviewed by the project owners.  The project owners can approve the request and allow the changes into the master copy.  Or they can decline the request.  Every declined request will include a specific reason for the decline.  Any declined request can be resubmitted and accepted once the decline reasons are addressed.

###Code Submission Procedure###
Every code submission to the core project must be submitted through the standard GitHub **Pull Request** feature.   Any effort to submit code changes to the project by any other means will be ignored.

###Coding Standard###
All programming code must conform to existing code standards found throughout the project.   It is important to maintain a consistent look-and-feel to the programming code.

###Approval Process###
Project owners will begin to review a pull request as soon as possible.  Depending on the size and scope of the changes included, it could take several days or even weeks before the request is accepted or declined.   Please be patient while we undergo our extensive review process for your changes.
