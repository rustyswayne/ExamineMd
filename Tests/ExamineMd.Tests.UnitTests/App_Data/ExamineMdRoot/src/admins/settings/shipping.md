##Introduction##
The Shipping page is where you manage your shipping providers. This allows you to have different providers based on shipment needs. You may have one provider for domestic packages, a different provider for foreign packages. You may have a third provider that handles bulk cargo. 

Begin by selecting the shipping countries, then the provider. Each shipping provider will need to be configured for weight or price per package.
