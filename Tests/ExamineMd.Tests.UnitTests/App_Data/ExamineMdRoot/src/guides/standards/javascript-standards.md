All JavaScript in the Merchello project should adhere to these guidelines. The legacy JS code in the core doesn't adhere to these guidelines but should be refactored so that it does.

All JavaScript in the back-office needs to be in a namespace and defined in a class.

##Namespaces##
To declare a namespace for your JavaScript class you simply use the following command (as an example to create a namespace called 'Umbraco.Controls'):

	Umbraco.Sys.registerNamespace("Umbraco.Controls");
The above code will require a reference to the NamespaceManager.js file which should generally be included by default in all pages in Umbraco.

##jQuery##
If you are going to use jQuery and it's dollar ($) operator, you will need to wrap your code in a self executing function, this is to ensure that your code will still work with jQuery.noConflict() turned on. Example:

	(function($) {
	  //your code goes here
	  alert($);
	})(jQuery);
To create jQuery plugins, see the jQuery Plugin Guidelines

##Creating classes##
There are actually quite a few different ways to create classes in JavaScript. For Umbraco we have opted to use the 3rd party, classical inheritance library, Base2 to make class declarations simple and extendable:

	Umbraco.Sys.registerNamespace("MyProject.MyNamespace");
	
	MyProject.MyNamespace.NamePrinter = base2.Base.extend({
	
	   //in order to make private methods/variables accessible
	   //to derived types, everything actually has to be public
	   //so to identify private variables, just prefix with an underscore
	
	   //private methods/variables
	
	   _isDebug: true,
	   _timer: 100,
	   _currIndex: 0,
	
	   _log: function (p) {
	      //this is a private method that can only be  
	      //accessed inside of this class
	      if (this._isDebug) {
	         console.dir(p);
	      }
	   }
	
	   //public methods/variables
	
	   name: ctorParams,
	   start: function() {
      this._log("start method called");

      //need to create a closure so we have a reference to our
      //current this object in the interval function
      var _this = this;

      //this will write the name out to the console one letter
      //at a time every _timer interval
      setInterval(function() {           
         if (_this._currIndex < _this.name.length) {
            console.info(_this.name[_this._currIndex]);
            _this._currIndex++;
         }
      }, _this._timer);
	   }
	
	})
Using the class above is easy:

	var printer = new NamePrinter("Shannon");
	printer.start();
	
	//or since we exposed the name property publicly, 
	//we can set it after the constructor
	var printer2 = new NamePrinter();
	printer2.name = "Shannon";
	printer2.start();

##Singleton classes##
Sometimes it's useful to have a class that can only be instantiated once and shared, rather than have multiple unsynchronised instances floating around. In those circumstances a Singleton pattern should be used.

Define a singleton class:

	Umbraco.Sys.registerNamespace("MyProject.MyNamespace");
	
	MyProject.MyNamespace.NamePrinterManager = base2.Base.extend({
	
	   //in order to make private methods/variables accessible
	   //to derived types, everything actually has to be public
	   //so to identify private variables, just prefix with an underscore
	
	   //private methods/variables
	
	   _registeredPrinters: [],
	
	   //public methods/variables
	
	   registerPrinter: function(printer) {
	      this._registeredPrinters[printer.name] = printer;
	   },
	   getPrinter: function(name) {
	      return this._registeredPrinters[printer.name];
	   }
	
	}, { //Static members
	
	   //private methods/variables
	   _instance: null,
	
	   // Singleton accessor
	   getInstance: function () {
	       if(this._instance == null)
	           this._instance = new MyProject.MyNamespace.NamePrinterManager();
	       return this._instance;
	   }
	
	});
Defining a singleton is the same as defining a regular class, except that we also define a static "getInstance" accessor for accessing the entity in a controlled mannor. By providing the static accessor we can ensure only one instance of the class is created per request.

Using the singleton is very easy:

	var printer = new NamePrinter("Shannon");
	MyProject.MyNamespace.NamePrinterManager.getInstance().registerPrinter(printer);

##Static classes##
Sometimes its useful to have static classes that require no constructor. Before you make one of these, definitely make sure that you wont require different instances of one.

Static classes are very easy:

	Umbraco.Sys.registerNamespace("MyProject.MyNamespace");
	
	MyProject.MyNamespace.Utility = base2.Base.extend(null, {
	
	   showMsg: function(msg) {
	      alert(msg);
	   }     
	})

Using the class/method requires no instantiation but you can therefore have no separate instances of Utility:

	MyProject.MyNamespace.Utility.showMsg("hello");

##The different between a Singleton class and Static class##
Both singleton and static classes allow you access methods directly without having to create an entity of your own. The main difference between the two, and what should govern when to use one over the other, is one of state.

A singleton class can hold information which can be manipulated and retrieved via it's public methods and will be stored between method calls, where as static methods should only manipulate and return values which it can gather from it's parameters and should not be persisted between individual method calls.

A good example of a Singleton is the one highlighted above, "NamePrinterManager". Here printers can be registered using the registerPrinter method for storage, and later retrieved using the getPrinter method. Here, a singleton is used as you will only want one central repository of printers.

A good example use of a Static class is for helper methods, where each method will perform a single self contained task based upon the parameters passed in and will return a immediate response.
