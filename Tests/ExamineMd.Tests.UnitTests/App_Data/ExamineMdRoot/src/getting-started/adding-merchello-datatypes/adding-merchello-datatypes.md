### Merchello Data Types

You need to connect the Merchello data type in the Developer/Data Types section so it can be used in an Umbraco/Settings/Document Type as a property. Merchello has 2 properties: product selector and product editor. 

#### Add Product Selector Data Type

In the Umbraco/Settings/Data Types, create a new Data Type called Merchello Product Selector. Choose the Merchello Product Selector as the Property editor. Umbraco will create the alias of Merchello.ProductSelector. Save the Data Type.
